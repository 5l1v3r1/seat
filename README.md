SEAT (Search Engine Assessment Tool) is the next generation information digging application geared toward the needs of security professionals. SEAT uses information stored in search engine databases, cache repositories, and other public resources to scan web sites for potential vulnerabilities. It’s multi- threaded, multi-database, and multi-search-engine capabilities permit easy navigation through vast amounts of information with a goal of system security assessment. Furthermore, SEAT’s ability to easily process additional search engine signatures as well as custom made vulnerability databases allows security professionals to adapt SEAT to their specific needs.
